# Student-performance-in-exam
The goal of this project is to take an indepth look at a student dataset which contains marks secured in various subjects by high school students from the United States, downloaded from kaggle. The dataset contains various information of 1000 high school students. The main objective of analyzing this data is to understand which factors influence students performance the most. To know which factor may affect the student's performance, we classify the score into couple of ranks, and figure out which feature affects the score more significant. The independent variables are follow:  gender : sex of students  race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students  parental level of education : parents' final education  lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced lunch)  test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
